We have some exciting news. It has now been one year since {{site.wordbrewery}} first went online; during that time, we have built one of the world's most unique and effective language-learning websites with no outside investment or full-time employees. We now have almost 6,000 users, and we have a long backlog of improvements and new features planned. These features include a mobile app (for both Android and iOS), quiz games and drills, and language courses that systematically teach the high-frequency vocabulary you need for fluency at any level.

While we are thrilled with the progress we have made, we want to go much further, so we are asking for your help. We want to improve the features we have while building new tools that will help you reach your goals. Accordingly, we are introducing a very affordable basic subscription at $4.99 per month that will make additional features and support available to paid subscribers. We hope you continue to enjoy {{ site.wordbrewery }} and welcome your feedback at [admin@wordbrewery.com](mailto:admin@wordbrewery.com).
