Earlier this week, we explained the basics of the [German case system]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-04-04-understanding-German-case-system %}). Although English does not have noun cases, it still has the remnants of a case system in its pronouns. This fact explains several points that confuse native English speakers as well as English language learners. Take a few minutes to understand how pronoun cases work in English, and you'll never confuse "who" and "whom" again.

*As with all concepts in grammar and language learning, the best way to understand advanced English concepts like pronoun cases is by [studying lots of real example sentences]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-15-one-sentence-at-a-time %})), as [WordBrewery](https://wordbrewery.com/) members do every day.

### English is a Germanic language, and it uses three cases in its pronoun system.

Contrast the following examples. Pay attention to how the form of the pronoun (I/me, he/his/him, she/her/hers, it/its) changes, and think about how its function in the sentence is changing:

#### 1. Subject pronouns are in the nominative case.

*To identify the subject of a sentence, ask: who or what is doing the main action (verb)?*

Q:
- *Who* ate the pizza?

A:
- *I* ate the pizza.
- *You* ate the pizza.
- *He* ate the pizza.
- *She* ate the pizza.
- *It* ate the pizza. (e.g., *the dog* ate the pizza)
- *We* ate the pizza.
- *They* ate the pizza.

This sentence is unremarkable, but it contains a lot of grammatical information.  What if we change it to say *The pizza ate him*? Grammatically correct, but a very different meaning because word order matters in English. And why can't we say *Her ate the pizza* or *The pizza ate she*? The answer: *Her* and *she* are not the correct case for these pronouns in these sentences.

#### 2. Possessive pronouns are in the genitive case.

**Possessive pronoun = [genitive case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case)**

*To identify the genitive case, ask: who or what is (gramatically) possessing something?*

Q:
*Whose* pizza did you eat?

A:
- I ate *my* pizza; it was *mine*.
- They ate *your* pizza; it was *yours*.
- We ate *his* pizza; it was *his*.
- You ate *her* pizza; it was *hers*.
- We ate *its* pizza. (e.g., we ate *the restaurant's* pizza)
- He ate *our* pizza; it was *ours*.
- I ate *their* pizza; it was *theirs*.

#### 3. Object pronouns are in the "oblique case," a hybrid of the accusative and dative cases.

**Direct object pronoun = [oblique case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_case), accusative variety**

*To [identify the direct object]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-18-what-is-a-direct-object %}) of a sentence, ask: who or what the target of the main action? Or: if `<verb>` is the action of the sentence, who or what is being `<verb>`-ed?*

Q: 
- *Whom* did you kiss?

A:
- You kissed *me.*
- She kissed *you*.
- She kissed *him*.
- He kissed *her*.
- They kissed *it*. (e.g., they kissed *the cat*)
- They kissed *us*.
- I kissed *them*.

**Indirect object pronoun = [oblique case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_case), dative variety**

*To [identify the direct object]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-18-what-is-a-direct-object %}) of a sentence, ask: who or what the target of the main action? Or: if <verb> is the action of the sentence, who or what is being <verb>-ed?*

Q:
- You sent *whom* a letter? (= You sent a letter *to whom*?)
- You cooked *whom* dinner? (= You cooked dinner *for whom*?)

A:
- You sent *me* a letter. (= You sent a letter *to me*)
- I sent *you* a letter. (= I sent it *to you*)
- She sent *him* a letter. (= She sent it *to him*)
- He sent *her* a letter. (= He sent it *to her*)
- We sent *it* a letter. (e.g., we sent a letter *to the government*)
- They sent *us* a letter. (= They sent it *to us*).
- We sent *them* a letter. (= We sent it *to them*).

#### Reflexive pronouns

Note also the following *[reflexive pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_pronoun)*. These are  indirect object pronouns that would take the dative case in German. "Reflexive" means the subject and object are the same. For example, if "I help myself", "I" and "myself" refer to the same person.

- I sent *myself* a letter. 
- You sent *yourself* a letter.
- He sent *himself* a letter.
- She sent *herself* a letter.
- It send *itself* a letter.
- We sent *ourselves* a letter.
- They sent *themselves* a letter.
