## Grammar note: "Lo"

"Lo" is a *pronoun.* A *pronoun* is a general word that replaces a specific noun or noun phrase. For example, the pronoun "she" (*ella*) might be used instead of a woman's name.

More specifically, "lo" is a *direct object* pronoun. In this sentence, it answers the question: "What does the speaker not know?" See a more in-depth [explanation of direct objects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-18-what-is-a-direct-object %}).

## 9. No, no lo creo.

<audio controls><source src="https://api.wordbrewery.com/api/tts/speak?code={{ site.code }}&amp;languageId=Spanish&amp;text=No, no lo creo."></source></audio>

**creo** | I believe (from **creer**, to believe)

Pay attention to the usage of "lo" again here. In this sentence, "lo" answers the question: what did the speaker believe?

We will discuss **verb conjugation** in future lessons. For now, notice a few things about this sentence:

- The word *yo*, meaning "I", is omitted.

- "Creo" means "I believe"; it is a **first person** form of the verb **creer**, which means "to believe."

- Because "creo" means "I believe" and not just "believe," Spanish speakers ordinarily do not specify the pronoun "yo" ("I") separately unless they want to emphasize that they are talking about themselves.

- English speakers often overuse the **personal pronouns** *I*, *you*, and *he/she/it* in other languages because English verbs do not change form depending on who is performing the action of the verb.

## 10. ¡Yo no soy así!

<audio controls><source src="https://api.wordbrewery.com/api/tts/speak?code={{ site.code }}&amp;languageId=Spanish&amp;text=¡Yo no soy así!"></source></audio>

**yo** | I

We met this word in the discussion above. Here, the speaker has chosen to use the pronoun to emphasize  that they are talking about themselves.

**soy** | I am (from *ser*, "to be")

## 11. ¿Por qué lo hace?

<audio controls><source src="https://api.wordbrewery.com/api/tts/speak?code={{ site.code }}&amp;languageId=Spanish&amp;text=¿Por qué lo hace?"></source></audio>

Pay attention to the usage of "lo" again here. In this sentence, "lo" answers the question: what did he/she/it do?

**por** | for
**qué**| what
**¿Por qué?** | Why? (lit. "For what?")
**hace** | he/she/it does (from **hacer**, to do)
