When I had one month’s notice before my trip to Thailand last year, I did what I always do before international trips: I tried to cram as much of the language into my mind as possible so that I could decode Thai script, use Thai for basic travel vocabulary, and have basic conversations in Thai with the local people.

I knew that if I could master only the 1000 most common Thai words, I would be able to recognize at least [70% of the Thai](http://goo.gl/UJTsDq) I was likely to encounter on my trip. So I found [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) vocabulary decks with English translations, loaded them onto my phone, and started trying to pound them into my head.

That, it turns out, doesn't work. Rote memorization of word-translation pairs is the most common method of studying vocabulary, but I realized that I was forgetting the words as soon as I moved to the next flashcard. Even with the help of Anki’s spaced-repetition algorithm, I was boring myself and wasting my time.

I made a vow to never again study isolated vocabulary words out of context. We don't read books featuring one word per page, or walk around communicating with one-word shouts. Instead,[we write and speak in sentences and phrases]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-15-one-sentence-at-a-time %}).

You can add game-like elements and nice graphics and animations to traditional flashcards, but ultimately these ornaments do not fix the core problem that by studying words in isolation, you aren't really studying a language at all. Studying a language means studying and imitating the actual communications of native speakers. So memorizing isolated words is neither effective nor rewarding.

This realization became one of the guiding principles of {{site.wordbrewery}}: we never ask you to memorize isolated words or definitions. Instead, we show you words as they actually occur: in the context of real sentences written by native speakers, for native speakers.
