One of {{ site.wordbrewery }}'s most useful features is the ability to create and export sentence and word lists to [Anki](http://ankiweb.net) or other flashcard apps for  extra practice.

Anki is a **[spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)**  flashcard application that has been
used by polyglots like Gabriel Wyner, author of *Fluent Forever,* Kevin Chen, co-founder of [Italki](http://italki.com), and
[Ryan McCarl](http://ryanmccarl.com), creator of {{ site.wordbrewery }}. Spaced-repetition systems try to show you the
item you are studying just when you are on the verge of forgetting it. Research shows that this improves long-term
retention. In addition, Anki users are able to fully customize their decks by adding audio, images, and even CSS styling.

{{ site.wordbrewery }} has just released our [first Anki deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2106258716) with a
curated selection of Spanish sentences from our database. The
[WordBrewery Core Spanish](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2106258716) deck helps you master the 500 most common Spanish
words in the context of over 1000 real sentences from the news. Each sentence was chosen from recent news articles
written for native speakers, and each sentence contains only high-frequency words (plus names). The deck also includes
professional translations as well as audio recorded by {{ site.wordbrewery }}'s professional
[Spanish-language voice actors in Venezuela.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-07-16-native-audio-for-spanish %})

This desk creates a strong foundation for beginners by enabling them to understand over 70% of the words they read and
hear. It is ideal for accelerated beginners and self-educators, first-year college students, students enrolled in AP
courses, and anyone wanting a thorough review of the most important Spanish vocabulary. In addition, it prepares you to
study {{ site.wordbrewery }}'s intermediate, advanced and master level sentences (not to mention the thousands of additional
beginner-level sentences in our database). All {{ site.wordbrewery }}'s sentences are authentic, accurate sentences from
the news that are packed exclusively with high-frequency words.

Anki-compatible lists at {{ site.wordbrewery }}. If you like the deck, please rate it and share it. Your support helps
