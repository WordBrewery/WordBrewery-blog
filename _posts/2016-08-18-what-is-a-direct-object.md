# What is a direct object, and how can you identify it in a sentence?

***Here is a simplified overview of English sentence structure:***

<p align="center">
Subject + Verb + Object<br>
= <br>
Actor + Action + What is acted upon
</p>

*Example*: **"The man bites the dog."**
<ul>
 <li>-- "The man" = the subject doing the action</li>
 <li>-- "bites" = the verb, i.e. action</li>
 <li>-- "the dog" = the direct object, i.e. what receives the action or what is acted upon</li>
</ul>
This sentence is obviously quite different from **"The dog bites the man."** How do we know that the man is the subject in one sentence and the object in the otherâ€”whether the man is doing the biting or being bitten? In English, we usually get this information from the word order: first comes subject, then comes verb, then comes object.

**Here are three questions you can ask to identify the subject, verb, and direct object of a sentence:**

<ol>
<li>Who/what did the action? (= subject)</li>
<li>What was the action? (= verb)</li>
<li>What did the subject [verb]? (= direct object)</li>
</ol>
