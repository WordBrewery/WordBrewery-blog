As described by Vilfredo Pareto in the late 19th century, the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) states that 20 percent of the input into a project yields 80 percent of the output. This 80/20 rule has been demonstrated across disciplines from economics to software engineering to language learning.

The 2,000 most frequently-used words in a language cover about 80% of most conversation and texts ([Nation 2001](http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/2001269892.pdf)), even in complex reading materials like economics textbooks and academic articles. These are words you probably use at least every other day. “Back,” “inside," and "home" are all within the 2,000 most common words in English. While 2,000 words may seem intimidatingly large, that is only a fraction of the more than [171,000](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language) words that the Oxford English Dictionary counts as currently in use in the English language.

The most frequently used word in English is “the”&mdash;in fact, it has been [shown](http://norvig.com/mayzner.html) to make up 7% of the words found in Google Books data. The 100 most frequently used words tend to be short and representative of the most crucial concepts across human history and culture: “person,” “be,” “good,” “not,” “time,” and “do.”

So you’re ready to master the top 2,000 words for your language of choice; but what is the most efficient way to do that? That is the problem that [led us to create WordBrewery](http://ryanmccarl.com/2015/10/09/developing-a-language-learning-program-high-frequency-sentence-identifier/).

{{site.wordbrewery}} is designed to teach languages with real sentences selected based on the frequency of the words they contain. {{site.wordbrewery}} starts you off with sentences that use only the most frequently used words in order to get you conversant faster.

Our intermediate sentences raise that to 3000 (about 95% coverage of most texts and speech); our advanced sentences raise it to 10,000 (about 99% of most texts and speech); and our master-level sentences include the 20,000 most common words, which is about [what would be expected of a university-educated native speaker](http://www.lextutor.ca/research/nation_waring_97.html).
