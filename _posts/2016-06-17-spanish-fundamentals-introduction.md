{{ site.wordbrewery }} is excited to announce our new Spanish Fundamentals blog post series. These posts will teach you many of the essential words and grammar patterns in Spanish. You will learn these naturally by studying simple but authentic phrases and sentences from recent news articles written by native Spanish speakers.

We have scoured thousands of recent Spanish-language news articles and chosen 300 sentences from them to teach you the essentials of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. If you study and memorize the sentences in this series, you will be well on your way to mastering the 500 most common words&mdash;which make up over 50% of the Spanish words you're likely to encounter in any given day&mdash;while also familiarizing yourself with the most important rules of Spanish grammar. With some practice, you will begin to experience what fluency feels like, because you'll be reading and understanding real sentences from the news&mdash;no definitions to memorize, no boring textbook, and no made-up sentences or canned phrases. Welcome to the first-ever Spanish course that lets you read and listen to real Spanish on day one.

All of the example sentences in this series will be taken from {{ site.wordbrewery }}'s sentence database. {{ site.wordbrewery }} collects hundreds of thousands of native sentences from news sites around the world. Our algorithm then tests each sentence to make sure it contains mostly high-frequency words. We believe that the fastest path to fluency is through mastery of the most common words, as the 5000 most common words make up 95% or the language used each day. We also know that you can master these words faster by learning them in the context of relevant content with short study sessions. The Spanish Fundamentals post series will apply these principles in a blog post format.

As you work through this course, practice reading more example sentences on {{ site.wordbrewery }}. You'll be surprised at how soon you start to recognize and understand the essential vocabulary and patterns you need to read Spanish. After you finish this book, you'll be ready to take the next step by signing up for {{ site.wordbrewery }}'s Accelerated Spanish course, which will be released in August.

Buena suerte!
