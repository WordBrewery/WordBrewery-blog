After perusing the foreign language shelf at your local bookstore, you stare puzzled at the spattering of books in your desired language. You may be a beginner, or perhaps an intermediate learner hoping to boost your vocabulary. Yet you are unable to choose even a dictionary. You may even feel intimidated or disgruntled - last time you selected a book, you found it lacking -  a waste of money!

Before you buy, here are some tips on choosing excellent language materials:

##The four skills

Remember that language study encompasses **listening, speaking, reading** and **writing**. If you are selecting a textbook, make sure there are exercises that you can use with each of these skills. Audio is crucial, especially for beginners. If possible, try to find how audio is used in the book - does it accompany dialogues, exercises or vocabulary lists? All three are preferred, but the most useful of these three is dialogues. You can use dialogues for speaking practice as well. Don't forget to look for writing prompts, at least one page-long reading passage per section with comprehension questions.

##Check the menu

If you want a book that will be of long term benefit, look for the following in the table of contents:

- Verb tenses (more than past-present-future should be accounted for)
- The Case System (all should be represented)
- Special phrases (elements that may not have an English equivalent, or something that is expressed differently than in English)

Look for tables, examples, exercises and a key to said exercises. Before choosing a book, research specific qualities of your language. If you are learning Russian or Modern Greek, check your book for accent markers and audio. A book on Modern Standard Arabic should contain a chart and explanation of the ten main verb forms or specific sections on the root system.

##Look for words

The next thing to look at is vocabulary. If the book doesn't boast its word count, try counting the number of words in the back glossary and multiple it by how many pages. A large vocabulary is crucial to improving all four of your main skills. If you are a beginner, look for at least a vocabulary over 1500+, possibly to 2000. This will ensure that you reach the middle intermediate range.

##Intermediate to advanced suggestions

Generally, it may be best to consider the following after finishing a beginner course, as an alternative to textbooks:

1) A comprehensive grammar book
2) A word list book/vocabulary practice book
3) A synonym book

Many reputable dictionaries now offer free online services, meaning that you can find any word you need. However, a good grammar book will have exercises in each category, and will preferably over ever detail of grammar.
A word list book can help you boost your language thematically, and you can use the internet to find audio/visual resources. A good synonym book will give you one thing your dictionary does not - solid context. A synonym book should not be a simple thesaurus. Rather, it should have sample sentences for misused or similar words. This can help you in discovering the subtle and sophisticated differences between common words.

##More materials

Readers, with or without audio, can be useful tools as well. But they generally have a limited lifespan, particularly those geared towards beginners. If you want to bypass textbooks, but not books completely as a beginner, I would suggest a reader with a grammar book and reliable dictionary.

If you are planning to take a certification exam, it might be worth your time to buy a book based on your goal - at least so you can understand the test.

Of course, as useful and gratifying as books are, there are many more ways to learn through digital media. Video, audio and text in your target language can all be found online, sometimes even for free. Before buying anything, it's important to plan your goals, survey your total resources, and then decide on which materials to use based on your budget and needs.
