Whether you need to fulfill a school requirement or beef up your resume, choosing a language to learn can seem intimidating. Even a top ten list is useless if you aren't sure what to look for. Here are three questions to help you find your perfect match:

1. *Which languages are similar to my native one*? If you notice the [Foreign Service Institute language divisions](http://www.atlasandboots.com/foreign-service-institute-language-difficulty/), you will find that the more distant the language is from English, the
higher the difficulty. In addition, a language's similarity to your native one will determine how many hours you need to become proficient. Check out sample phrases, preferably with audio, and maybe peruse some grammar articles to get an idea of what to expect.

However, don't settle for the "easier" language. Every language from Spanish to Chinese has its own challenges and nuances. And keep in mind that your passion for that language will sustain your studies.

2. *What kind of media do you like?* Most countries have books, films, games and TV serials available in their native language. However, the production quality or accessibility of each may be different. For example, you will find a plethora of Korean dramas and films online, but novels may be more difficult or costly. Japanese or Spanish are more likely to have accessible video game subtitles or audio from US vendors than Arabic.

Look to your hobbies and see if you can easily integrate that language into your daily life. Keep in mind that cultural expression is vast. German music includes everything from opera to reggae. At least one language will have something that interests you.

3. *Which languages could I use professionally?* This question should be taken with a grain of salt, because many languages may be applicable to your field, or the languages
relevant may change. Currently if you are interested in business, try German or Mandarin.
If you are studying Middle Eastern policy, you may want to look into Hebrew or Farsi as well as Arabic. If you are studying Arabic, you will have to choose a dialect depending on the region that interests you most.

Overall, the invested interest is the crucial element. Find a language you like, and do something you love in that language.
