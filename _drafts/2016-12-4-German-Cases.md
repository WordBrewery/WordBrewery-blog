Grammatical case marks the function of a noun and its modifiers in a sentence. A modifier may be a pronoun, adjective, or article. German has four cases: Nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive.

The **nominative case** marks the *subject* of the sentence, the doer of the action.

**Er würde gerne bleiben.**

**Er** | He
**würde ...bleiben** | would...to stay
**gerne** | like

**Das Papier gab mehr als einen Prozent nach.**

**Das Papier** | The paper
**gab...nach** |decreased
**mehr als einen Prozent** | more than one percent

Here the pronoun *Er* and the article-noun pair *Das Papier* are in the nominative case. The nominative form will be identical to the dictionary form of the word.  

Nominative case is also used when you want to say something is something else. For example:

**Er ist ein guter Student.**

Here, both *Er* and *ein guter Student* are in the nominative case.

The **accusative case** marks the *direct object*, and may be used with certain verbs and prepositions.

**Den Rest machen wir zusammen.**

**Den Rest** | Rest
**machen wir** | we make/do
**zusammen** | together

Notice the article **den**. This is an accusative article for the masculine **Der**. Because German uses the case system, word order is rather flexible. *Den Rest* is directly receiving the action (*machen*), which the subject performs (*wir*). You can flip the positions *wir* and *den Rest* and the meaning remains the same.

The **dative case** marks the *indirect objec*t. An indirect object is not the primary object of the verb, but it is still affected by the action. It may be used with certain verbs and prepositions.

**Was genau stört Sie an dem Gesetz?**

**Was genau** |  What exactly
**stört Sie** | bothers you
**an dem Gesetz** | about the law

Here, the preposition *an* takes the dative case.

The **genitive case** marks *possession*. However, it may also be used with certain prepositions and verbs.

**Und er hat das Talent des Vaters.**
**Und er hat** | And he has
**das Talent des Vaters** | the talent of his fathers, his father’s talent

In this example, the genitive case showing ownership. Keep in mind the following pattern: X[the thing being owned] + genitive case article + Noun [the owner].
