Output activities such as speaking and writing are considered essential skills to language learning - especially for those learners aiming to [conquer the plateau](

Reading provides you with [ample access to new vocabulary and grammatical structures](http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijel/article/viewFile/22597/14583). Learning each new word in context through reading will then give you a new term to use in conversation. The most difficult part of this is transferring the new knowledge from your passive memory to your active memory. Here are some tips to transform what you read into what you speak:

##Read outloud

When you find a new word, trying reading the entire sentence outloud.  Based on the new word or sentence, try formulating two or three new sentences using the new information. This will help you become familiar with how the word sounds and how to use it.

##Summarizing and Mimicry

After reading a passage, you can also try using one sentence as a prompt. Starting with that sentence, speak spontaneously and try to create a story. If you are feeling out of ideas, summarize what you've read. You can use this exercise for writing practice as well. Simply pick a sentence and try to mirror the structure with vocabulary you already know.

##Pronunciation practice

Another technique is to recite the text. This is most often used with poetry or drama. It works especially well if you have an audio recording. Use the text to practice pronunciation and intonation. If you have access to audio, try recording your voice with your phone or computer and match it to the original. See if you can find where the two recordings diverge and where you should improve.

When it comes to the reading skill, reading comprehension is made up of grammar and vocabulary. Both are crucial to speaking, vocabulary even more so than grammar. Reading can be used to give wider context to words, with which you then can practice using in conversation - first in mock dialogues, and then with native speakers.
