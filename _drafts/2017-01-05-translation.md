Translation exercises can be a fantastic learning tool, if used properly. A study by [Dagiliene](http://www.kalbos.ktu.lt/index.php/KStud/article/viewFile/1469/2164) in 2012 found that students using translation prompts improved their reading, vocabulary and grammar. While vocabulary acquisition via translation is more controversial, many supporters boost its usefulness in grammar study.


##Translation is structure

More than in spontaneous conversation, in which a student struggles to remember the words, translation focuses attention to the structure of the language. Let's look at this German sentence with a word-by-word translation alongside the correct English sentence:

*Heute bin ich gl√ºcklich verheiratet und Vater.*
Today **am** I happily married and father.
Today I **am** happily married and **a** father.

Three points can be deduced from translating one sentence:

-The verb appears in the second position.
-All German nouns should be capitlized, if you compare *Vater* and *father*.
-The article "a" is missing from the German. While German has articles corresponding to a/an and the, we can deduce that there are certain rules of when to use them. In this statement, the speaker is describing themselves: I am X. We can note that maybe this kind of statement does not require an article.

You can then choose to translate the sentence back into German for practice - or try to create your own, replacing the words with new vocabulary following the structure of this sentence. Keep your grammar notes to the side and come back to them when writing and translating another sentence.

French teachers [Steve Smith](http://frenchteachernet.blogspot.in/2015/07/so-what-point-of-translation.html) and [Francocoti]( https://gianfrancoconti.wordpress.com/2015/07/12/translation-part-1-the-case-for-translation-in-foreign-language-instruction/) have found translation exercises to be more useful to **beginners**, as it hones accuracy and creates a foundation for later spontaneous speaking and writing.
