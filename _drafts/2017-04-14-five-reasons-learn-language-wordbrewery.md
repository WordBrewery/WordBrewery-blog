## Here are five reasons that {{site.wordbrewery}} is a revolutionary way to learn a language:

In the video above, WordBrewery founder WordBrewery founder [Ryan McCarl](http://RyanMcCarl.com)) discusses what makes WordBrewery different from other language-learning sites and offers five reasons to consider studying a language with {{ site.wordbrewery }}: 

(1) Study [real sentences from the news]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-02-19-learn-language-one-sentence-at-time %}) instead of computer-generated, dumbed-down, or crowdsourced sentences; 

(2) [Focus on high-frequency vocabulary]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-08-16-pareto-principle-and-language-learning %}) so you learn as efficiently as possible; 

(3) Study at any level, including intermediate and advanced, with an inexhaustible supply of fresh content; 

(4) [Master grammar and vocabulary in context]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-15-one-sentence-at-a-time %}), [not through rote memorization]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-0615-how-wordbrewery-teaches-vocabulary-in-context%}); and 

(5) Focus on your areas of interest by choosing to read sentences about specific topics, which can [give you a big head start in understanding the sentences](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3586468?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).
