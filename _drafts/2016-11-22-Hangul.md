The invention of the Korean alphabet Hangul is attributed to King Sejong of Korea in 1443. He hoped to create a simple written language that even the [common people](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VCqLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) could learn. It contains a total of 24 letters rather than thousands of characters.

Despite being phonetic, Hangul is not written like Latin characters, with one character after another in a linear fashion. Instead, Hangul is written in blocks, usually composed of 2-4 letters.

These blocks are written in phonetic order, from left to right and up to down. The way the block is written depends on the medial letter is a horizontal letter or vertical letter. A horizontal or vertical letter refers to how the sign is written. Letters like ㅗ (o), and ㅜ (u) run on a horizontal axis, while signs like ㅏ (a) and ㅓ (eo) are on a vertical axis.

The initial letter is always a consonant. Rather than begin with a vowel, a word may start with the zero letter ㅇ.

The initial letter always appears first, at the top. If the middle letter is horizontal, it is written below the initial letter. A final letter is written after it.

If the syllable is vertical, it will be written to the right of the initial character, and the remaining syllables will be at the bottom.
