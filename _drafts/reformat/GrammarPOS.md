Language often looks like the Kizhi Pogost, a church off of Russia’s Lake Onega built without a single nail. To a beginner vocabulary appears as a random slur of sounds. While the builders of Kizhi Pogost must have relied on the strength of their materials and complex mathematics, a language learner depends on grammar.

Grammar is essential to a strong second language foundation. But before you dive into target language rules and regulations, it is crucial to first understand your native grammar.

The nine parts of speech are the main components of a sentence:

**Nouns** - A noun can be a person, place or an object. Examples include: *Henry*, *London*, and *house*.

**Adjectives** - An adjective is a word that describes a noun: *pretty* vase, *professional* Sam, or *fast-paced* London.

**Determiner** - This includes articles, *a, an* and *the*, as well as demonstrative adjectives like *these* and *that*. A determiner will define the specificity of the noun.

**Preposition** - These brief words have no other function than to tack on more information to the sentence via linking nouns. Example words are *to*, *for*, and *over*.

**Verb** - Verbs are complicated creatures. A verb describes the action of the sentence, the *what*. Verbs abide to the time the action took place, called *tense*, as well as how the action happened, known as *mood*. Examples are: *to eat*, *to drink*, *to read*.

**Adverb** - An adverb describes the verb: He ate *quickly*, she walked *smoothly* out the door.

**Conjunction** - A conjunction combines two items – whether they be individual parts of speech or full sentences.

**Interjection** - an interjection is a word that expresses an emotion. “Wow”, “Well” and “Oh my” are only a few examples.

Grammar doesn’t have to be boring or difficult. Our elementary grammar series will break up each of these components into easy to digest tips and definitions – making it easier to navigate each target language sentence.
