The neural networks in the brain strengthen as a result of language learning. â€” Michael Gove" caption="As Britain's Education Secretary, [Michael Gove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gove) advocated [making foreign language education compulsory](http://www.bbc.com/news/education-15135560) starting at age five." %}

Researchers have found that bilingualism not only increases the amount of [gray matter in the brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583091/), but it also uses various parts of the brain. Bilingual people show improved listening and attention abilities. This means that people who know two languages may be able to better process new information. 

Further research has concluded that age is not a factor - anyone from [babies to the elderly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583091/) benefit from language learning. In one study, seven month-old children from bilingual homes could learn new rules in a study whereas monolingual children could not. In adults and the elderly, bilingualism fends off the decay of cognitive functions. Researchers have also found that speaking more than one language can [delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease](https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/does-being-bilingual-make-you-smarter).


Cognitive neuroscientist [Ellen Bialystok](http://lcad.lab.yorku.ca) suggests that rather than being inherently smarter than monolinguals, [bilinguals show an improvement in certain brain functions](http://www.scilearn.com/blog/does-being-bilingual-make-you-smarter). Bilinguals are better able to pay attention, organize, plan and switch focus than monolinguals.

This may imply that bilingualism helps to refine certain brain activities which give bilinguals an edge in multitasking and decision-making.

These are just the health benefits of learning a language. A second language can also give significant [economic](http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2000/01/in-florida-it-pays-to-be-bilingual-university-of-florida-study-finds.html) and [social](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814054044) benefits.
