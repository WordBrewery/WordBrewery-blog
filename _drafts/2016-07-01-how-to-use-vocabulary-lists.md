Making vocabulary lists is an almost universal practice among language-learners. But once you have made a list, what do you do with it?

**1. Beware of productive procrastination.**

I once saw a native English speaker in a 10th-grade Honors English class meticulously creating flashcards for every word on her study list. The list included the word "murky," so she made a flashcard with that word on one side and the definition on the other. Since she was a native English speaker with a strong vocabulary, I asked her if she didn't know the word murky already, and she said yes, she did know it. But nevertheless she was making a flash card for it along with the other words on the list.

Simply writing out a word or sentence by hand strengthens your memory of the word or sentence. And flashcards coupled with a [spaced-repetititon system](https://wordbrewery.com/blog/spanish/wordbrewery-spanish-core-anki-deck/)definitely have a place in language learning. But it is easy to go through the motions of studying vocabulary by doing things like making flashcards from a vocabulary list. Since making flashcards can be time-consuming, we recommend using them to focus on particular sentences, words, or grammatical constructions that are giving you trouble. Do not waste time making flashcards for words you already know.

**2. A word's definition is a temporary crutch, not the target of your efforts.**

Quick: define the word "cat."

If you are like most people, you do not know a "definition" of either that word or any other word you use on a regular basis. You can probably create a definition for it, but doing so requires some thought. And yet surely you *know* the word "cat." You know it fluently because you can instantly recognize it when it appears in texts or speech, and you can automatically summon it without conscious effort when you need it in your own speech and writing. That is what fluency means. Fluency does not mean memorizing definitions.

And yet for centuries, language learners have studied vocabulary by trying to memorize definitions of isolated words, just as the classmate mentioned above was trying to do with the word "murky." This is an inefficient and low-value study method. So if you are studying basic Japanese and you learn that "neko" (猫 | ねこ) means "cat," you could make a flash card with "neko" on one side and "cat" on the other, but that is not the only approach. Consider these options:

(1) Associating "neko" with a picture of a cat. This method is advocated by Gabe Wyner in *Fluent Forever*, and it will be familiar to users of [Memrise](https://memrise.com). I find this method too time-consuming, but it works if the process of gathering pictures and matching them to words can be crowdsourced, as it is at Memrise.

(2) Associating the word "neko" with a specific cat you know. This is how children would likely first learn the word "cat." "Cat" first means the household cat, and only later is abstracted to the general concept of "any cat."

(3) Making a flash card of an authentic sentence containing the word "cat." This is our preferred approach: that is why {{ site.wordbrewery }} always teaches words in the context of real sentences and never in isolation. It works much better than memorizing isolated words and is much more rewarding and enjoyable. Consider: even if you have never studied a word of Japanese, you probably now know the word "neko" simply because I have used it in four sentences in this post. That is what efficient, painless language-learning feels like.

(4) Not making a flash card at all—instead, just keep reading, and review the word as needed when it comes up in the context of future sentences. If I am right that you now know the word "neko," making a flashcard for it would be tedious and redundant. Better to move on to conquer new words as they arise in the context of new sentences.

**2. Do not study the words in isolation**.

A vocabulary list typically contains only isolated words. But in real communication, words typically occur only in the context of sentences or phrases. To know a word means



So you have compiled the ultimate vocabulary list with relevant and frequent words, perhaps by using [WordBrewery](https://wordbrewery.com) to study high-frequency words in the context of authentic sentences. How can you most efficiently learn your list, beyond using spaced repetition? Here are a few strategies:

**1. Guess the meaning through context**. In his article on [teaching vocabulary](http://www.heinemann.com/shared/onlineresources/E00648/chapter1.pdf), Scott Greenwood describes this traditional method as a way to learn a general translation. The main problem here is that you may not recognize most of the words in a sentence. At WordBrewery, we give you one new word per sentence, so you never have to worry about learning more than one word at a time.

**2. Review the definition**. If you encounter a tough study word, consulting a dictionary will give you the most accurate understanding of the word.  [Mehring](http://www.hpu.edu/CHSS/English/TESOL/ProfessionalDevelopment/200680TWPfall06/03Mehring.pdf) suggests reading the definition before reading the entire sentence. If you don’t feel comfortable guessing through context alone, try reading the translation first.

**3. Simplify the definition**. After reading, see if you can [summarize](http://www.readingmatrix.com/files/11-m9371u67.pdf) the definition to a simple translation in your target language. Do the same with the sentence. This strategy will help you learn vocabulary via processing the new word in the target language.

**4. Find new contextual examples for difficult words**. This gives you more examples of when to use the word and it enriches the definition. The more [contextual associations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-15-how-wordbrewery-teaches-vocabulary-in-context %}) you make, the easier it will be to remember.

To make these processes easier, make sure to keep an example sentence for each vocabulary word on your study list.
