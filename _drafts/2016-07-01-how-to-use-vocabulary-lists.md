You have compiled the ultimate vocabulary list with relevant and frequent words, possibly using [WordBrewery](https://wordbrewery.com). How can you most efficiently learn your list, beyond using spaced repetition? Here are a few strategies:

**1. Guess the meaning through context.** In his article on [teaching vocabulary](http://www.heinemann.com/shared/onlineresources/E00648/chapter1.pdf), Scott Greenwood describes this traditional method as a way to learn a general translation. The main problem here is that you may not recognize most of the words in a sentence. At WordBrewery, we give you one new word per sentence, so you never have to worry about learning more than one word at a time.

**2. Review the definition.** If you encounter a tough study word, consulting a dictionary will give you the most accurate understanding of the word.  [Mehring](http://www.hpu.edu/CHSS/English/TESOL/ProfessionalDevelopment/200680TWPfall06/03Mehring.pdf) suggests reading the definition before reading the entire sentence. If you donâ€™t feel comfortable guessing through context alone, try reading the translation first.

**3. Simplify the definition.** After reading, see if you can [summarize](http://www.readingmatrix.com/files/11-m9371u67.pdf) the definition to a simple translation in your target language. Do the same with the sentence. This strategy will help you learn vocabulary via processing the new word in the target language.

**4. Find new contextual examples for difficult words.** This gives you more examples of when to use the word and it enriches the definition. The more [contextual associations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-15-how-wordbrewery-teaches-vocabulary-in-context %}) you make, the easier it will be to remember.

To make these processes easier, make sure to keep an example sentence for each vocabulary word on your study list.
