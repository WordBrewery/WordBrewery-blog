"Daisy chaining" languages means that you use knowledge of one or more languages to learn another. In other words, if your native language is English and your second language is Spanish, you can use both of these to learn Portuguese, Italian or French. In this way, you create a "chain" of languages.

This technique can be useful, even if you only dabble in the third language. In learning two languages within the same family you will better understand subtle differences in grammar, pronunciation and word usage. Overlapping patterns will give you more information about the Romance languages overall, which in turn will help you if you wish to move on to French or Italian.

This technique can even be applied in a broader sense. Because languages are vast histories of geography, trade and migration, you
may find connections where you least expect them. If you know Spanish, you may want to use your knowledge to learn Arabic. [Due to Moorish rule in Spain from 711-1492](http://people.math.sc.edu/rorabaug/docs/ArabicInfluence.pdf), many Arabic words made it into the Spanish language. This includes [loan words used in English](www2.ignatius.edu/faculty/turner/arabicspanish.htm), such as:

- *cotton* | algodón |  القطن(al-qutun)
- *sugar* |  el azúcar |  السُكَّر(as-sukkar)
- *jasmine* | el jazmín | الياسمين(al-yaasmiin)
- *almanac* | el almanaque |  المطنوخ(al-maTnuukh)

If you take this route, you can then use Arabic to learn languages like Hebrew, Turkish, Farsi or Hindi.

If you plan on daisy chaining your languages, keep these tips in mind:

1. *Don't learn more than one language from scratch at a time.* Learning even one language takes time and effort. In learning two, you are essentially cutting your study time in half. This means you may progress at a slower pace. You may also mix up grammar rules or vocabulary.

2. *Differentiate by level.* Always make sure your languages are on different levels. Having too many languages at the "beginner" stage could confuse you, as you will be practicing the same kind of vocabulary. Instead, wait until you have a strong foundation in each language before adding a new one. For example, if you speak English and Japanese but want to move on to Korean and Chinese, learn Korean to the intermediate level and then start Chinese. This way, the risk for confusing these two languages is lower.

3. *Research before you choose* Before you choose which language to leap to next, it helps to look at the general history of the languages you already know.
First observe the linguistic data - which languages are in your language family? Which languages have influenced the ones I know over time? It's also important
to gauge your interest in those languages, as well as your goals. Do you like the way it sounds? Does it fit with your career goals?
