In order to work or study abroad, you are often required to prove your language proficiency. Language proficiency certificates tend to give learners a solid goal to work towards, as there are exams for every level with specific and clear criteria.

European language departments are centered around the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CERF), while Japanese students will take the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) and Chinese students the HSK. Students of Arabic may take an exam
from the American Council of Teachers of Foreign Languages (ACTFL). English learners will take the TOEFL or IELTS examinations. Although each exam is unique, all require proficiency in the following components: speaking, listening, reading, writing.

WordBrewery currently focuses on improvements in reading and vocabulary acquisition. We have already explained the important of [learning in context](https://wordbrewery.com/blog/learning/how-wordbrewery-teaches-vocabulary-in-context/) and
[learning high-frequency words](https://wordbrewery.com/blog/learning/pareto-principle-and-language-learning/). In learning through contextual sentences with high-frequency words, we believe that it is possible to use WordBrewery in conjunction with other materials to prepare for these examinations.

A crucial element to language learning is vocabulary acquisition. Our four levels cover 20,000 words - enough for each exam. We have compared the word count of our levels to each exam and the approximate level of fluency each represents:

To optimize your studying with WordBrewery, here are some tips to cover the other three elements:

1. **Listening** - Use the audio option to listen to the sentence and write what you hear before fully reading the sentence.

2. **Speaking** - After listening to the audio, try saying the sentence aloud. Use the phrases you've learned in a new sentence, or search our database for more examples with one click. Repeat the sentences as often as you can.

3. **Writing** - Try to write a new sentences with the vocabulary, and add more context. Create a mini-article of one or two paragraphs based on that one line. If you need more help, you can click on the source button to read the original article
before you write your own.

Bonus: **Grammar** - Diagram the sentence. See if you understand what each word is doing. This will help in many of the advanced in exams, in which they may ask you to spot mistakes. Developing a keen eye for grammar rules will help you to recognize these later on.
