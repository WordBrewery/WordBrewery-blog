{{ site.wordbrewery }}'s explore mode may seem directed towards individual study sessions. However, it can be used in a variety of ways - including in the classroom.

For students, independent or otherwise, learning a single sentence is the easiest way to discover new vocabulary and grammar without a sensory overload.

Try this warm-up exercise with your students to improve reading and grammar:

1. Ask students to find 3-5 sentences from our database as homework (or in class if you are using computers).

2. Have them translate and diagram the sentences.

3. This should take about ten to fifteen minutes. Ask them to share their sentences in class, and have their classmates take note of important grammar points or new vocabulary.

For intermediate and advanced students, this exercise can also be extended into a reading session:

1. As homework, ask your students to find one sentence they find interesting, translate and diagram it.

2. Then tell them to click on the "source" icon beneath the sentence and read through the original article as best they can.

3. They should then write a few sentences summarizing the article, which they then can share with their classmates - either in a presentation format or in small groups.

This exercise in particular is a great way to support not only language and cultural studies, but also current events.

If you decide to take the presentation route, you may decide to make a list of new vocabulary your students have discovered during these sessions. Conversely, you may ask them to pick sentences based on vocabulary in their textbook.

{{ site.wordbrewery }} has a search feature, allowing for students to find specific words covered in class or in their textbook.

Students can also save words or sentences into lists and export them into [Anki](www.ankisrs.com), a flashcard system designed to reintroduce words after a certain amount of time - thus eliminating the threat of the [forgetting curve](https://uwaterloo.ca/counselling-services/curve-forgetting).
