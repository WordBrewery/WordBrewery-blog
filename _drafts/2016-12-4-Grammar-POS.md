Grammar is essential to a strong second language foundation. But before you dive into target language rules and regulations, it is crucial to first understand your native grammar.

In English, these nine parts of speech are the main components of a sentence:

**Nouns** - A noun can be a person, place or an object. Examples include: *Henry*, *London*, and *house*.

**Pronouns** - A pronoun takes the place of the noun in the sentence. Examples are *he*, *her*, and *I*.

**Adjectives** - An adjective is a word that describes a noun: *pretty* vase, *professional* Sam, or *fast-paced* London.

**Determiner** - This includes articles, *a, an* and *the*, as well as demonstrative adjectives like *these* and *that*. A determiner will define the specificity of the noun.

**Preposition** - These brief words have no other function than to tack on more information to the sentence via linking nouns. Example words are *to*, *for*, and *over*.

**Verb** - Verbs are complicated creatures. A verb describes the action of the sentence, the *what*. Verbs abide to the time the action took place, called *tense*, as well as how the action happened, known as *mood*. Examples are: *to eat*, *to drink*, *to read*. When we change a verb based on tense and number of people speaking, we call this *conjugation*.

**Adverb** - An adverb describes the verb: He ate *quickly*, she walked *smoothly* out the door.

**Conjunction** - A conjunction combines two items â€“ whether they be individual parts of speech or full sentences.

**Interjection** - an interjection is a word that expresses an emotion. "Wow!", "Well..", and "Oh my!" are only a few examples.

The parts of speech can be found in various forms across languages. For example, German nouns have three genders: Masculine, feminine and neuter. Arabic verbs conjugate based on gender. Japanese verbs, in contrast, conjugate based on whether the action is affirmative or negative. Russian does not have the determiners *a*, *an*, or *the*. 

Grammar doesn't have to be boring or difficult. Instead, practice grammar for ten minutes a day by labelling the function of each word in a sentence.
