## Welcome to {{ site.wordbrewery }}!

{{ site.wordbrewery }} is a new language-learning app and website that helps you achieve fluency one sentence at a time. WordBrewery pulls real, recent, and relevant sentences from news sites around the world, then uses these sentences to teach you the high-frequency vocabulary words you need to master in your target language. Each sentence you study on {{site.wordbrewery}} will bring you closer to mastery of the vocabulary and grammar you need to reach your goals. It gives you real experience reading and listening to your target language from day one. For a limited time, we are offering early adopters a basic subscription for only $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year.

Your support is essential to our success. Subscriptions help us build the mobile app, game mode, and language courses we are working on. They also help us continue to add features like native-speaker audio, human-edited translations, and advanced natural language processing tools that help you learn as efficiently as possible.

## Here are five reasons that {{site.wordbrewery}} is a revolutionary way to learn a language:

### 1. WordBrewery teaches languages one sentence at a time.

WordBrewery founder [Ryan McCarl](http://RyanMcCarl.com) created WordBrewery because he wanted a way to study languages as efficiently as possible in the "hidden moments" of each day—time spent commuting, waiting in line, waiting on hold, etc. (The idea of using "hidden moments" to study languages comes from Barry Farber's fantastic *[How to Learn Any Language]*). We know that people learn best with short study sessions and dr Quentin 

### 2. WordBrewery teaches vocabulary and grammar only in the context of real sentences.

{{ site.wordbrewery }}'s sentences are written by native speakers, for native speakers.

### 3. WordBrewery teaches sentences packed with high-frequency words.

### 4. WordBrewery is ideal for intermediate and advanced learners, including international students and even native speakers.

### 5. WordBrewery's topics filter helps you read relevant materials in your area of interest.

You can choose what topics you want to read about—news, sports, business, technology, or travel, for example—and we will show you sentences from news articles in those topic areas. This makes it easy to focus on your areas of interest, and your content knowledge about a particular topic can [give you a head start in understanding an article](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3586468?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). By the time you start interacting with native speakers, you’ll be able to base your conversations on information you’ve learned by reading the same news sources they read every day.



Because people learn best with [context]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-15-one-sentence-at-a-time %}) and short bursts of activity, our unit of study is the sentence—not the artificial conversation or the isolated vocabulary word. {{site.wordbrewery}} users are never asked to study words out of context: if we show you a word, we will show you an example sentence along with it whenever possible. All of our sentences are scraped from news sources that are written by native speakers for native-speaker audiences.

Our algorithm only scrapes sentences likely to be useful and readable to language learners at different levels. The sentence database refreshes constantly and discards sentences after a period of time unless our sentence scoring algorithm believes the sentence is particularly valuable or unless a user saves the sentence to a study list. So our sentence database gets bigger and better automatically every day. And you can help improve our content for yourself and other users by saving useful sentences so they will never be deleted and by reporting problematic sentences so we can delete them manually.

{{site.wordbrewery}}’s commitment to using real sentences makes our method in some ways more challenging than that of other sites, because real sentences are unpredictable. But we flatten the learning curve by allowing you to filter sentences by difficulty, look up any word by clicking the word (or moving your cursor over it), and retrieve a translation of full sentences with two clicks.

We track your level of understanding and gradually learn which words you know well and which you need to practice. In our Quiz Mode and language courses, which are currently in development, we will use this data to show you sentences that we have chosen specifically for you: sentences that we think you can read, but that will be a just slightly above your skill level to help you make progress.

## What do you want in a language-learning app?

We built {{site.wordbrewery}} because we wanted a way to learn, practice, and review languages and master core vocabulary in the most efficient way possible while using only real content. And we wanted a system that would allow us to make progress in short bursts at any stage of our learning, so we never feel like we have to start over again as beginners.

But what do you want? We want {{site.wordbrewery}} to be useful for you, so please let us know what you like, what you think could be better, and what would make you come back for more. Consider [taking a short beta tester survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VLYcHdI5-FLlr5hMRJ1DzhLKDUzfkPvyI8Bx3bvvk3w/viewform) to let us know.
